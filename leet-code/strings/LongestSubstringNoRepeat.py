# Algorithm
# - When we iterate through, we will keep count of the max substring that we encounter, as well as when the subarray started
# - We will iterate over the string and will keep a count of the indexes of our seen elements
# - I can check if the element is a duplicate access by looking at where the index occurs - we can overwrite the previous index with a new one once we resee it
